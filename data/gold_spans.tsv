chu50_en_26	1	I am seeing him because he has presented two peripheral neurological episodes suggesting a Parsonage Turner syndrome.						False
chu50_en_26	2	I will briefly review the family history.						False
chu50_en_26	3	He has no children, has two healthy sisters, one of whom has type I diabetes and has three healthy children; his other younger sister has no children and is in good health.	type I diabetes	61.0	15.0	False	HP:0100651	True
chu50_en_26	4	There are no notable neurological antecedents in his parents or in the more distant family.						False

chu50_en_26	15	This recurrence has suggested a possible Parsonage Turner syndrome.						False
chu50_en_26	16	We discussed with the patient the interests and limitations of genetic testing.						False
chu50_en_26	17	There is a gene named SEPT9 that can be mutated in Parsonage Turner syndromes, but this is not always the case.						False
chu50_en_26	18	When a mutation is found, it means that the patient has a slightly higher risk of recurrence, although this is not certain.						False
chu50_en_26	19	This is an autosomal dominant pathology, and when a mutation is found, it is often useful to perform a blood test on the parents or direct relatives.						False
chu50_en_26	20	However, even when no mutation is found, this does not exclude the diagnosis, which remains clinical since not all genes are certainly known.						False
chu50_en_26	21	I will also provide a certificate for possible emergency care in case of recurrence to avoid delaying corticosteroid treatment, which is currently recognized as the treatment to try to limit sequelae, even if the treatment works variably depending on patients and episodes.						False

chu50_en_27	1	I am meeting them as part of a family investigation because I know their daughter Pensée and their granddaughter Gabrielle.						False
chu50_en_27	2	I had initially met Gabrielle, who presents bilateral Madelung deformity for which genetic examinations were performed that identified a variant of unknown significance in the form of a duplication upstream of the SHOX locus currently described.

chu50_en_27	3	This duplication was subsequently found in Gabrielle's mother.						False
chu50_en_27	4	Mr. and Mrs. GADBOIS brought me radiographs of Pensée that I will have read carefully.						False
chu50_en_27	5	Regarding the grandparents, they are here to continue the family investigation to try to clarify the pathogenicity of this variant or not.						False
chu50_en_27	6	I had also requested complete sequencing of the gene from the Nantes laboratory to ensure that we do not overlook a more known variant.						False
chu50_en_27	7	Regarding Mr. and Mrs. GADBOIS, they are both in good health.						False
chu50_en_27	8	Mr. GADBOIS has a history of lumbar compression fracture from a car accident and an older operated ankle fracture.						False

chu50_en_27	13	She measures 1.51 m but previously measured 1.55 m with a wingspan of 146 cm (E/T 0.94 if we take into account the previous height); she presents a right wrist deformity that she had not previously noticed, which does not hinder pronation-supination and is not painful, which could correspond to a minimal Madelung deformity.

chu50_en_27	14	Nothing else to report.						False
chu50_en_27	15	On her radiographs, which are also being interpreted, we find fairly short femoral necks; it is difficult to interpret the interpedicular widening as the X-ray is somewhat obscured by osteoarthritis.	find fairly short femoral necks;	57.0	32.0	False	HP:0100864	True
chu50_en_27	16	A narrow lumbar canal is not completely excluded.						False
chu50_en_27	17	Regarding the forearm radiographs, the bone relationships are quite atypical on the right with possibly a slight fork-like deformity at that level, and I am therefore awaiting the official interpretations.						False
chu50_en_27	18	Discussion and conclusion: I met today with Mr. and Mrs. GADBOIS, whose daughter and granddaughter present a variant of unknown significance in the SHOX gene, this gene being suspected in the presence of bilateral Madelung deformity in their granddaughter.	bilateral Madelung deformity in their granddaughter	204.0	51.0	False	HP:0003067	True
chu50_en_27	19	In the family, it does not seem that height is very significantly affected, and it is also quite possible that some individuals carry a mutation without having a Madelung deformity, which makes interpretations and genotype-phenotype correlations difficult.	Madelung deformity,	162.0	19.0	False	HP:0003067	True
chu50_en_27	20	Nevertheless, there are some arguments in Mrs. GADBOIS for suggesting a right Madelung deformity and an involvement of the SHOX gene causing a height of -2 DS.	Madelung deformity	78.0	18.0	False	HP:0003067	True
chu50_en_27	21	Both members of the couple agree to undergo a blood test today; we will contact them with the results.						False
