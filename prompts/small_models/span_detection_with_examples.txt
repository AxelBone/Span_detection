Task: Extract clinical phenotypes from the sentence.  
A clinical phenotype is a symptom, sign, abnormality, or patient condition explicitly stated.
 
Rules:
- Copy spans exactly as written (no rephrasing or paraphrasing).
- Keep relevant modifiers (e.g. “chronic”, “lower back”, “mild”).
- If multiple phenotypes are present, output multiple spans.
- Do not infer or hallucinate missing information.
- If no phenotype is present, output: `{"spans":[]}`

Output format (strict JSON only):  
`{"spans":[{"span":"<text>"}]}`
Examples:  
SENTENCE: "She reports chronic lower back pain and frequent headaches."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"chronic lower back pain"},{"span":"frequent headaches"}]}`

SENTENCE: "On examination, he has mild hepatomegaly."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"mild hepatomegaly"}]}`

SENTENCE: "No abnormal movements were observed during the visit."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"abnormal movements"}]}`

SENTENCE: "MRI of the brain was normal."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[]}`

Now process:  
SENTENCE: "{sentence}"
