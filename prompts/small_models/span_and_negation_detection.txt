Task: Detect clinical phenotypes in the sentence and determine whether each phenotype is negative.

A negative phenotype includes cases where a condition is explicitly denied, absent, ruled out, normal, or reported as not occurring.

Rules:

- Extract spans exactly as written (verbatim).
- Keep relevant modifiers (e.g., "chronic", "lower back", "mild").
- Mark `negation=true` if the phenotype is absent, denied, normal, or negative.
- Mark `negation=false` if the phenotype is present.
- If multiple phenotypes are present, output multiple spans.
- Do not infer or hallucinate information not present in the sentence.
- If no phenotype is present, return: `{"spans":[]}`

Output format (strict JSON only):  
`{"spans":[{"span":"<text>","negation":true|false}]}`

Sentence: "{sentence}"
