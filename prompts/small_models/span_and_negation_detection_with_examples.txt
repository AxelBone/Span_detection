Task: Extract clinical phenotypes from the sentence and determine whether each phenotype is negative.

A negative phenotype includes cases where the condition is denied, absent, normal, unremarkable, or not occurring.

Rules:

- Extract spans verbatim from the sentence.
- Mark `negation=false` if the phenotype is present.
- Mark `negation=true` if absent, denied, or reported as normal.
- If `negation=true`, provide also `span_without_negation` by removing the negation words.
- If `negation=false`, set `span_without_negation` equal to `span`.
- If multiple phenotypes exist, output multiple spans.
- If no phenotype exists, return: `{"spans":[]}`
- Do not infer or hallucinate information.
- Output strict JSON only.
    

Examples:  
SENTENCE: "She reports chronic lower back pain."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"chronic lower back pain","span_without_negation":"chronic lower back pain","negation":false}]}`

SENTENCE: "He denies chest pain and shortness of breath."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"chest pain","span_without_negation":"chest pain","negation":true},{"span":"shortness of breath","span_without_negation":"shortness of breath","negation":true}]}`

SENTENCE: "Neurological examination was normal."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"neurological examination","span_without_negation":"neurological examination","negation":true}]}`

SENTENCE: "He has fever and vomiting."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"fever","span_without_negation":"fever","negation":false},{"span":"vomiting","span_without_negation":"vomiting","negation":false}]}`

SENTENCE: "MRI of the brain was unremarkable."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[{"span":"MRI of the brain","span_without_negation":"MRI of the brain","negation":true}]}`

SENTENCE: "She went to school yesterday."  
OUTPUT: `{"spans":[]}`
