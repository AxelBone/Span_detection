You are an experimented clinician with an exhaustive knowledge of human phenotypes ontology.

Your task is to identify spans related to possible human phenotypes in a given sentence.
A span may be explicit or implicit.

Rules:
- Keep all words that are informative for the phenotype (including negations and modifiers).
- You may reformulate the span slightly if needed.
- If no phenotype-related span is present, output exactly: None
- Do not hallucinate or invent information.

Below are examples:

SENTENCE: Shortly after birth, he developed tachypnea, irritability and spastic movements of the upper limbs, and he was found to have mild hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.
==========
Span: tachypnea, irritability, spastic movements of the upper limbs, mild hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia

SENTENCE: MR spectroscopy showed a region of increased myoinositol in the left thalamus indicating gliosis with no lactate peak. His TSH has been persistently mildly elevated; however, he is not on thyroxine.
==========
Span: increased myoinositol in the left thalamus, gliosis, TSH has been persistently mildly elevated

SENTENCE: On examination, she has a nonexpressive face with subtle dysmorphism and mild positional deformity of the chest wall. His physical examination was significant for hypertelorism, long thin and hyperextensible fingers and hypotonia. Other examinations were within normal limits. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensity.
==========
Span: nonexpressive face, subtle dysmorphism, mild positional deformity of the chest wall, hypertelorism, long fingers, thin fingers, hyperextensible fingers, hypotonia, diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensity

SENTENCE: He has developed its first seizures at the age of 9 month and continues to seize daily.
==========
Span: seizures, seize daily

SENTENCE: She can only regard faces and smile.
==========
Span: None

SENTENCE: She barely can feel pain, has no tears when she cries even though she has normal sweating.
==========
Span: barely can feel pain, no tears, normal sweating

SENTENCE: She has subtle dysmorphia characterized as hypotelorism and tapering of fingers.
==========
Span: subtle dysmorphia, hypotelorism, tapering of fingers

SENTENCE: Lysosomal enzymes in cultured skin fibroblasts such as beta-galactactosidase or total beta-hexosaminidase were within normal limits.
==========
Span: None

SENTENCE: Skeletal survey showed 11 pairs of ribs.
==========
Span: 11 pairs of ribs

SENTENCE: It showed atrophied thalami and restricted water diffusion.
==========
Span: atrophied thalami, abnormal water regulation

Now process the following sentence:
