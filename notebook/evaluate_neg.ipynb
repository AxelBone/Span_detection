      "Dear Colleague,\n",
      "We jointly saw young Antoine GARCIA, born on 15/10/2020, in a neurogenetics consultation with Dr. BARRIÈRE on 22/01/2024, accompanied by both parents, for an etiological assessment of hemifacial microsomia associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n",
      "Regarding the family history, we recall that Antoine has an older sister born in 2014 who is in perfect health. His mother also experienced three early spontaneous miscarriages. Antoine’s parents are not consanguineous and are both in good health. There is no contributory family history, except for ADHD in a paternal cousin.\n",
      "Concerning Antoine himself, the pregnancy was spontaneous, with no abnormalities detected on prenatal ultrasounds. Antoine was born at term with a birth weight of 3450 g (37th percentile) and a length of 50.5 cm (37th percentile). We do not have information regarding his head circumference (no health record available).\n",
      "Antoine adapted well to extrauterine life. Left-sided hemifacial microsomia with major aplasia of the left ear was noted at birth, leading to a malformation workup including cervical spine radiographs, renal ultrasound, and cardiac ultrasound, which were reportedly normal, although we do not have the official reports. Antoine has never undergone a brain MRI.\n",
      "Regarding psychomotor development, he began walking at 17 months, but independent and stable walking was not achieved until 25 months, having sat independently rather late, around 12 months of age. Currently, at 3 years of age, he does not climb stairs and does not kick a ball.\n",
      "Concerning language development, first words reportedly appeared around 26 months of age. Currently, he is beginning to combine a few words but presents articulation difficulties, knows a few signed words, and has started using pictograms. He appears to understand instructions well, recognizes some animals, but does not yet know colors.\n",
      "Toilet training has not been achieved. However, he is generally independent with dressing and undressing when motivated.\n",
      "There is no history of regression and no history of epilepsy.\n",
      "He is receiving care at a CAMSP (early childhood medical-social center), with psychological follow-up. He has also undergone neuropsychological assessments confirming developmental delays.\n",
      "He was seen in a clinical genetics consultation two years ago, without subsequent genetic testing.\n",
      "On clinical examination today, at 3 years and 2 months of age, Antoine measures 91 cm (-1.5 SD), weighs 10.8 kg (-2 SD), with a head circumference of 47 cm (-2.5 SD). He was noted to be very cooperative and smiling during the examination. As expected, left-sided hemifacial microsomia with major ear aplasia was observed. There is a mild ocular asymmetry without obvious epibulbar dermoid. There are no abnormalities on intraoral examination, including no dental anomalies. There are no abnormalities of the extremities, no cutaneous anomalies, no cardiac murmur on auscultation, and no abdominal masses on palpation. The spine is straight without gibbus. Neurologically, deep tendon reflexes are present and symmetrical, with no sensory or motor deficit, no cranial nerve involvement, no cerebellar signs, and no spasticity.\n",
      "Overall, Antoine presents with a combination of features suggestive of Goldenhar syndrome, also known as oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n",
      "We explained to the parents that the etiology of Goldenhar syndrome remains poorly understood, with both genetic and environmental factors having been identified. We also clarified that patients typically do not present with neurodevelopmental disorders, making it difficult to establish a direct link between the malformation and the developmental delays observed.\n",
      "In this context, a brain MRI and CGH-array analysis were prescribed today.\n",
      "We will review the case once the results of these investigations are available.\n",
      "Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require any additional information.\n",
      "Kind regards,\n",
